# Simple laser focus rig.

For very little money you can get a diode Laser on the web.  Some of
these are quite powerful and in order to play around with the focus on
these you really do not want to mess around with your face (and eyes!)
close to these.

So I designed a simple focus rig that uses a stepper motor to move the
focus ring on the laser while I watch the result via a webcam behind a
filter.

I no longer have the entire setup or the code I used to control the
stepper, but all you need is an arduino, a weldig glass, and somewhere
to mount the laser and something to point it to that won't burn.  Top
tip: if you shoot at a target that is at an angle you'll have an
easier time judging how narrow the focus dot is.  Also beware that
diode lasers do not produce round beams.  They are somewhat
elliptical.
